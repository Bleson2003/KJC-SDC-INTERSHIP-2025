**📅 Day 3 - MongoDB Integration**

**✅ Task: Student Enrollment System using MongoDB**

Java Application to:

Manage students, courses, and enrollments.

Demonstrate use of embedded vs referenced documents.

**📋 Requirements:**

**✅ MongoDB Collections:**

students — stores student details

courses — stores course details

enrollments — stores enrollment records

**✅ Document Structure:**

One enrollment embeds student and course details.

Another enrollment references student and course documents via ObjectId.

**🚀 To-Do:**

Insert sample student and course data.

Create enrollments:

One with embedded documents.

One with referenced ObjectIds.

Query and print both types with full details.

Update a student's name:

Observation: Updating embedded vs referenced documents shows how references remain consistent across documents, while embedded data must be updated in every instance.

Create indexes on the students collection for efficient querying.

Include screenshots of:

Students collection

Courses collection

Enrollments collection
